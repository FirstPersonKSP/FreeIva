// the KV2Pod and KV3Pod airlocks are not aligned with where the internal hatch is.  This patch moves them.
// This has a risk of breaking existing craft files and vessels in flight (because the hatch may now be obstructed) 
// if you want to disable this behavior, simply delete this patch or change the file extension.
